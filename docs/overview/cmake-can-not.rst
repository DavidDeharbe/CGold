:ref:`CMake <CMake>` has its strengths and weaknesses. Most of the drawbacks
mentioned here can be worked around by using approaches that may differ from
your normal workflow but reach the end goal. Try to look at them from another
angle, think of the picture as a whole and remember that advantages definitely
outweigh the disadvantages.

Language/syntax
===============

This is probably the first thing you will hit with. :ref:`CMake <CMake>`
language is not something you can compare with what you have likely used
before. There are no classes, no maps, no virtual functions or lambdas. Even
parsing functions input arguments and returning results is something quite
tricky for the beginners.  :ref:`CMake <CMake>` is definitely not a language
you want to try to experiment with to implement red-black trees or to
process JSON responses from a server.  **But it does** handle regular
development very efficiently and you probably will find it more attractive than
XML files, autotools configs or `JSON-like syntax`_.

Think about it in this
way: if you want to do some nasty non-standard thing then probably you should
stop.  If you think it is something important and useful, then it might be
quite useful for other :ref:`CMake <CMake>` users too. In this case you need to
think about implementing new feature **in CMake itself**.  :ref:`CMake <CMake>`
is an open-source project written in C++, I hope this language has enough power
for you :) Also you can discuss this problem in `CMake mailing-list
<https://cmake.org/mailman/listinfo/cmake-developers>`_ to see how you can help
with improving current state.

.. _affecting workflow:

Affecting workflow
==================

This might sounds contradictory to the statement that you can
:ref:`keep using your favorite tools <keep using your favorite tools>` but it's
not. Yes, you still can work with your favorite IDE but you must remember that
:ref:`CMake <CMake>` now is in charge.

Imagine you have C++ header ``version.h``
generated automatically by some script from template ``version.h.in``. You see
``version.h`` file in your IDE, you can update it and run build and new variables
from ``version.h`` will be used in binary, but you **should never** do it since
you know that source is ``version.h.in`` in fact.

Quite the same happens when you use :ref:`CMake <CMake>` - you should never
update build configuration in IDE as you usually do, you have to remember that
IDE files generated from ``CMakeLists.txt`` and all your updates will be lost
next time you run :ref:`CMake <CMake>`.

Wrong workflow:

  :align: center

Correct workflow:

.. image:: /overview/images/good-workflow.png
  :align: center

That said, it's not enough to know that if you want to add new library to your
``Visual Studio`` solution you can do:

* :menuselection:`Add --> New Project ... --> Visual C++ --> Static Library`

You have to know that this must be done by adding new
``add_library`` command to ``CMakeLists.txt``.

Incomplete functionality coverage
=================================

There are some missing features in :ref:`CMake <CMake>`. Mapping of
CMake functionality <-> :ref:`native build tool <Native build tool>` functionality
is not always bijective. Often this can be workarounded by generating different
native tool files from the same CMake code. For example it's possible using
autotools create two versions of library
(:doc:`shared + static </tutorials/libraries/static-shared>`) by one run.
However this may affect performance or even not possible for other platforms
(e.g. on Windows). With :ref:`CMake <CMake>` you can generate two versions of
project from one ``CMakeLists.txt`` file: one for shared and one for static
variant, effectively running generate/build twice.

With ``Visual Studio`` you can have two variants x86 and x64 in one solution
file. With :ref:`CMake <CMake>` you have to generate project twice:
once with ``Visual Studio`` generator and one more time with ``Visual Studio Win64``
generator.

Same with ``Xcode``. In general :ref:`CMake <CMake>` can't mix two different
toolchains (at least for now) so it's not possible to generate ``Xcode``
project with ``iOS`` and ``OSX`` targets - again, just generate code for each
platform independently.

.. _unrelocatable projects:

Unrelocatable projects
======================

Internally :ref:`CMake <CMake>` save full paths to the sources so it's not
possible to generate project and then share it between several developers.
It means you can't be CMake-guy who will generate different projects for
Xcode-guys and VisualStudio-guys. All developers in team at least should be
aware of how to generate projects using CMake. On practice it means they have
to know CMake arguments to use, literally it's
``cmake -H. -B_builds -GXcode``/``cmake -H. -B_builds "-GVisual Studio 12 2013"``,
plus remember workflow notes from the section above.
Next logic can be applied here: if you're working with developer then developer
should learn tools you've used, if you're working with users then it's your
responsibility to create user-friendly installers like ``*.msi`` instead of
projects.

.. admonition:: CMake documentation

  * `CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS removed since CMake 3.4 <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.4.html#deprecated-and-removed-features>`__

Even if relative paths feature will be implemented (re-implemented) developers
should still have :ref:`CMake <CMake>` installed since it was used in fact:

* When you do change ``CMakeLists.txt`` :ref:`CMake <CMake>` detects it
  automatically and run regenerating
* Obviously in case if you have some custom build steps with ``cmake -E`` (command line mode) or
  ``cmake -P`` (scripting mode)
* For doing internal stuff like searching for installed dependent packages
